# Thesis LaTeX Template
A minimalistic LaTeX template suitable for a University thesis.

It is a simplified version of one of the Overleaf templates. It should work on most TeXLive packages shipped with distributions.

You can use pygmentex for code snippets. For example: 
```
pygmentex main.snippets
```
